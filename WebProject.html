			<p>The making of this game is originally inspired from the rules of <i>Yu-Gi-Oh! The Duelists of the Roses</i>, yet it also attributes to some elements from Chess and Dungeons and Dragons.
			<br>The game has two types of gamemodes: <b>War Zone (WZ)</b> and <b>Battlefield (BF)</b>; <b>WZ</b> is the expanded version that accounts to many different variables to win the game while <b>BF</b> is a smaller, fast-pace, and simplistic gamemode.</p>

			<td><div>&emsp; This is a card template. Based off of <i>Yu-Gi-Oh!</i>, the upper border is the <i>name</i> and <i>element</i> of the warrior. 
			An <i>element</i> is a warrior attribute that provides a rock, paper, scissors mechanic especially under situations on the time of day or the terrain they're under. 
			For instance, a fire warlock will overpower an ice mage in combat but if they're in the mountains during a blizzard the warlock will get weaker while the mage gets stronger, 
			turning the tides of battle.<br> 
			<br>&emsp; Below the border is the <i>summoning cost</i> of that warrior. Each turn, you will receive <i>+3 summoning points</i> and out of 9 in total you can use it to summon your warrior in exchange for your points.<br>
			<br>&emsp; The image on the center of the card is the canvas of your warrior.<br>
			<br>&emsp; As for the bottom border, it tells you the warrior-type and description of that warrior, sometimes telling you if it has a special effect.<br>
			<br>&emsp; The very bottom, underneath the horizontal line, is the statistics of that warrior.<br> 
			<br><i>Attack</i> mode is the stance your card is in when facing forward. As such, when you move or initiate an offense manuever you're always in <i>Attack</i>. If you smite the enemy with this card, you will deduct your opponent's life points by your <i>Attack points</i> subtracted by your opponent's. If it failed, however, it becomes vice versa.<br>
			<br><i>Defensive</i> mode is when you hold your ground by positioning your card sideways. If your card is ever defeated in this position, you will not lose health points. If it's a successful hold, the enemy loses health points from what is deducted between your card's defense against your opponent's offense.

					<dl>
						<blockquote>
						<dt><u>Infantry Movement</u> : </dt>
							<dd>An <i>Infantry</i> is the most general type of movement in the game. Once it's your turn, each card can move one unit that is horizontal or vertical from that card as long as the space is vacant.</dd>
							<p>
							&emsp; &emsp; <img src="Infantry.png" alt="Image failed to load" width="116" height="116">
							</p>
						<dt><u>Vanguard Movement</u> : </dt>
							<dd>The <i>Vanguard</i> is a power-up the player has earned through card or on the field i.e. most commonly riding a horse. The benefit of it is that it can move twice as far when compared to an <i>Infantry</i>. 
								This is useful for mobilizing your forces much faster than the enemy can or have your warrior spearhead your army into battle. 
								In addition, this power-up can be passed onto other <i>Warriors</i> as well as yourself. However, it is possible to lose this ability if the horse used were to die, run away, or traded into a village. 
								The horse needs to be well rested and in top condition for it to be a powerful tool for your army.</dd>
							<p>
							&emsp; &emsp; <img src="Vanguard.png" alt="Image failed to load" width="116" height="116">
							</p>
						<dt><u>Cavalry Movement</u> : </dt>
							<dd>The <i>Cavalry</i> movement is a type of unit that moves to set up a position rather leading straight ahead. It can be earned the same way as the <i>Vanguard</i>. 
								When compared to an <i>Infantry</i>, the <i>Cavalry</i> moves diagonally while the <i>Infantry</i> (needs to move vertically or horizontally to reach its diagonal destination, not simply from Point A to Point B).
								Such as the <i>Vanguard</i>, this power-up can be exchanged and lost if not kept in well maintenance.</dd>
							<p>
							&emsp; &emsp; <img src="Cavalry.png" alt="Image failed to load" width="116" height="116">
							</p>
						<dt><u>How to Capture</u> : </dt>
							<dd>The advantage to capturing an enemy is to turn the tide of battle with positioning when the foe is too strong to fight against. Capturing a target will keep a maximum of 5 <i>Warrior cards</i> in custody and doing so will allow you to reveal
								if there's enemy <i>Trap or Spell cards</i> near your cards or even reveal one card in your opponent's hand. You can only reveal one card per turn, and it's not guaranteed for the enemy card to spill the intelligence to you; the primary approach to determine 
								if the captive will cooperate with you is dependent on a dice roll. The player who rolls the dice number closest to the card's summoning level will decide. If you win the roll, the <i>Warrior</i> tells you what the enemy knows; if the enemy wins, the <i>Warrior</i> resists the
								the interrogation so you need to try again next turn. You can only interrogate the captive(s) once per turn. Other advantages are that you can strip the enemy from his power-ups, the enemy can't revive them since they're still on the field, and you can use their life to pay a sacrifice or a ritual before your own army.
								To capture a target you need to surround the enemy -- regardless if it's one or more -- vertically and horizontally such as the examples provided below. Once the enemy is captured, you get to control where the card moves. If the enemy overlaps your captured target, it will be reclaimed and be in the bottom of the enemy's deck to be used again.
								If the enemy <i>Deck Leader</i> were to ever end up in a situation like this then it's Game Over. However, to capture the <i>Deck Leader</i> you need to occupy the diagonal spaces as well to prevent the enemy from summoning any more cards.</dd>
